Mining the Twitter Feed location tweets to help check Place freshness

Team Members: Frank Kelly, Will Fergus, Yuntao Zhang

Team Name: House Baratheon

Description: Approx 1-2% of all Tweets are Geo-Tagged. That's still a lot of data. What can we do with that?

Idea #1: Community Manager uses it to spot potential "experts". "Hey @kellyfj1 we see you love Restaurants in Boston - we do too. We need your help . . . ."

Idea #2: Cluster nearby tweets and display via D3.js

Idea #3: Can we find Create-A-Place candidates from tweets e.g. "Just went to a new awesome restaurant XYZ" (with Geo-Tag)

I am sure there are more ideas that take Twitter Geo-Location and do something interesting . . . See also the complete Twitter history here http://topsy.com/s?q=New%20Restaurant&type=tweet

Likely Technologies: Java Twitter client, D3.js (for cluster visualization) e.g. https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery
